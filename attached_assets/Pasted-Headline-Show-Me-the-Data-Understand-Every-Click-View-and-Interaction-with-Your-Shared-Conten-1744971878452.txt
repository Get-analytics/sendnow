CTA: Read Their Stories


"Sendnow has completely changed how I understand my audience. As a marketer, I used to guess which parts of my presentations were resonating. Now, with Sendnow's heatmaps, I have clear visual data that's helping me refine my content for better engagement. It's like having X-ray vision for my presentations!" - Sarah M., Marketing Manager


"As a video creator, knowing if people are actually watching my entire video or dropping off is crucial. Sendnow's detailed video analytics, showing watch time and even when viewers rewind, is a game-changer. I can now tailor my content to keep my audience hooked. Finally, meaningful video stats in one place!" - Raj Patel, Content Creator


"For my small business, Sendnow is an absolute steal. The free plan allowed me to share important documents with clients professionally, and even with the limited features, I got more insight than just knowing if they clicked. Upgrading to the Basic plan was a no-brainer for the increased limits and the ability to export analytics. It's making a real difference in how I track engagement with my proposals." - Lisa K., Small Business Owner


"I love how Sendnow handles all my file types. Whether it's a PDF report, a quick image, or a video presentation, I can upload it, get a short link, and see how people are interacting with it. The location data is also surprisingly useful for understanding my global reach. It's so much better than using multiple separate tools." - David Chen, Sales Executive


"Sendnow's Pro plan is a powerhouse. The custom domain option makes my shared links look incredibly professional, and the increased file upload limit has been a lifesaver. The heatmaps for my longer documents are invaluable for understanding where readers are focusing. Plus, knowing I have priority support gives me peace of mind. This tool is worth every penny." - Maria Garcia, Training Consultant
